Mal was done taking orders, he immediately charged into the room to do, in his eyes, what needed
to be done. With pin point accuracy, he began to shoot down each and every one of the culprits.
After 15 shots fired, he'd already disposed of all but two. One had taken safe cover behind the
couch, while the other had taken the mother by her neck as a cover from Mal's bullets which had 
yet to miss. 

The academy had held trainings on specifically this scenario. And Mal was well versed on what to 
do. He was supposed to do what the criminal wanted, so as not to risk the life of the hostage. But
the culprit made a mistake. He had 4 inches of his head exposed to Mal. And that was all Mal needed
for a clear shot. 

"Don't shoot, you don't wanna...", BANG, the culprit fell to the floor. All of a sudden, the remaining
criminal jumped out the window immediately. In the duration of the next two seconds, Mal realized
he'd made a mistake. On the dead man's hand, he saw a dead man's switch. Immediately Wooks burst into 
the room.

"There's a bomb !"
 
Wooks grabbed Konnors by his shirt and jumped out the window closest to them barely managing to
get out of the explosion that followed.
